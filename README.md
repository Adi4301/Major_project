Doctor Handwriting Recognition

The Doctor Handwriting Recognition project aims to create a system that can understand and interpret the handwriting of doctors. Many times, doctors write notes and prescriptions by hand, and it's not always easy for others to read. This project uses technology to recognize and convert the handwritten notes into digital text that can be easily understood and stored in a computer system.
